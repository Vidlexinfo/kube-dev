# Lab K201 - Application Routing with Ingress Controllers


## Pre Requisites

  * Ingress controller such as Nginx, Trafeik needs to be deployed before creating ingress resources.
  * On GCE, ingress controller runs on the master. On all other installations, it needs to be deployed, either as a deployment, or a daemonset. In addition, a service needs to be created for ingress.
  * Daemonset will run ingress on each node. Deployment will just create a highly available setup, which can then be exposed on specific nodes using ExternalIPs configuration in the service.

### Create a Ingress Controller

An ingress controller needs to be created in order to serve the ingress requests. Kubernetes comes with support for **GCE** and **nginx** ingress controllers, however additional softwares are commonly used too.  As part of this implementation you are going to use [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) as the ingress controller. Its a fast and lightweight ingress controller and also comes with great documentation and support.  

```bash


+----+----+--+            
| ingress    |            
| controller |            
+----+-------+            


```

There are commonly two ways you could deploy an ingress

  * Using Deployments with HA setup
  * Using DaemonSets which run on every node

We pick **DaemonSet**, which will ensure that one instance of **traefik** is run on every node.  Also, we use a specific configuration **hostNetwork** so that the pod running **traefik** attaches to the network of underlying host, and not go through **kube-proxy**. This would avoid extra network hop and increase performance  a bit.  

You could refer to [official traefik docs](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/kubernetes/) to understand the installation options and how to use those.

Deploy ingress controller with daemonset as

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-ds.yaml

```

Validate
```
kubectl get svc,ds,pods -n kube-system  | grep -i traefik
```

[sample output]

```
service/traefik-ingress-service   ClusterIP   10.102.73.90   <none>        80/TCP,8080/TCP          72s
daemonset.apps/traefik-ingress-controller   2         2         2       2            2           <none>                        72s
pod/traefik-ingress-controller-gnfwt           1/1     Running   0          71s
pod/traefik-ingress-controller-sxts6           1/1     Running   0          71s
```

You would notice that the ingress controller is started on all nodes (except managers). Visit any of the nodes 8080 port e.g. http://IPADDRESS:8080 to see  traefik's management UI.

### Setting up Named Based Routing for Vote App

We will direct all our request to the ingress controller now, but with differnt hostname e.g. **vote.example.com** or **results.example.com**. And it should direct to the correct service based on the host name.

In order to achieve this you, as a user would create a **ingress** object with a set of rules,


```bash


+----+----+--+            
| ingress    |            
| controller |            
+----+-------+            
     |              +-----+----+
     +---watch----> | ingress  | <------- user
                    +----------+

```


`file: vote-ing.yaml`

```
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: vote
  namespace: instavote
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
spec:
  rules:
  - host: vote.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: vote
          servicePort: 80
  - host: results.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: results
          servicePort: 80
```

And apply

```
kubectl get ing
kubectl apply -f vote-ing.yaml --dry-run
kubectl apply -f vote-ing.yaml

kubectl get ing
kubectl describe ing vote
```

Since the ingress controller  is constantly monitoring for the ingress objects, the moment it detects, it connects with traefik and creates a rule as follows.


```bash

                    +----------+
     +--create----> | traefik  |
     |              |  rules   |
     |              +----------+
+----+----+--+            ^
| ingress    |            :
| controller |            :
+----+-------+            :
     |              +-----+----+
     +---watch----> | ingress  | <------- user
                    +----------+

```

where,

  * A user creates a ingress object with the rules. This could be a named based or a path based routing.
  * An ingress controller, in this example traefik constantly monitors for ingress objects. The moment it detects one, it creates a rule and adds it to the traefik load balancer. This rule maps to the ingress specs.


You could now see the rule added to ingress controller,

![Traefik with Ingress Rules](../images/traefik02.png)

Where,

  * **vote.example.com** and **results.example.com** are added as frontends. These frontends point to respective services **vote** and **results**.

  * respective backends also appear on the right hand side of the screen, mapping to each of the service.

#### Adding Local DNS

You have created the ingress rules based on hostnames e.g.  **vote.example.com** and **results.example.com**. In order for you to be able to access those, there has to be a dns entry pointing to your nodes, which are running traefik.

```bash

  vote.example.com     -------+                        +----- vote:81
                              |     +-------------+    |
                              |     |   ingress   |    |
                              +===> |   node:80   | ===+
                              |     +-------------+    |
                              |                        |
  results.example.com  -------+                        +----- results:82

```

To achieve this you need to either,

  * Create a DNS entry, provided you own the domain and have access to the dns management console.
  * Create a local **hosts** file entry. On unix systems its in `/etc/hosts` file. On windows its at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. You need admin access to edit this file.


For example, on a linux or osx, you could edit it as,

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

And add an entry such as ,

```
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx vote.example.com results.example.com
```

where,

  * xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the actual IP address of one of the nodes running traefik.

And then access the app urls using http://vote.example.com or http://results.example.com
